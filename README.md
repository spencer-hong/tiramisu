# tiramisu
 A file management system with the base-layer-container approach

Files are digested at the base level. Any edits/changes/expansion of files are saved as layers on top of the base.   
Each file is a container that may contain more than one file. This allows Tiramisu to maintain parent-child relationships and one-to-one & one-to-many relationships. 

 Created for the archive-digestion project
